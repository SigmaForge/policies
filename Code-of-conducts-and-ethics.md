Q: How can we be more compassionate?

---

Every member of Sigma Forge is expected to behave and act to a high standard of decency, integrity and professionalism. This code of conduct applies to all employees, directors, officers, board members, advisors, and part time or temporary staff. 

As members of Sigma Forge, we wish to make a positive contribution to our society and environment beyond our work. With this in mind, **we agree to abide to this code of conduct at all times**. We agree that any breach of this code, both in spirit and in letter, outside of business hours, or during unrelated activities, should be considered in the same way as any breaches during normal business hours.

We believe that this document should be more than just a set of standards we hold ourselves to, and is a relevant guide and compass for our actions.

## 0 - COMPANY VALUES

1. Always care about the human
2. Be radically honest and open
3. Strive to excel in our craft and as people
4. Respect all people in all our dealings
5. Positively contribute to the future for all

We wish Sigma Forge to have a lasting, sustainable and positive contribution to our society.

We agree to behave always with integrity and honesty and respect with all people and in all our dealings, both while working as a member of Sigma Forge and otherwise.

We care about and value each other, our customers, partners, suppliers and the public. Our actions reflect our compassion.

We are proud to work for this organisation and to call all its members our peers. Our actions should always ensure that we can continue to be proud of our work and our peers in the future.

## 1 - COMMON DECENCY AND CONDUCT
In this first section, we describe a base standard of decency and conduct that is to be followed at all times. We agree that by breaching any of these standards, we act in a way that prevents us from being members of Sigma Forge, and that we may be dismissed or pursued legally due to our actions.

### Illegal activities
We agree to respect and follow the law of the countries we operate in. We take respect for the law seriously and accept that criminal or illegal activity of any kind is grounds for immediate dismissal from Sigma Forge.

### Willfull deception
Willfull deception of any kind, either through outright lying, omission or not volunteering relevant information at our disposal is a poison for any organisation. We will not tolerate it in ourselves or in our peers. 

### Use of company resources
We agree to use company resources in the following three ways:

* To further the values and objectives of Sigma Forge
* To contribute to our community in a positive and sustainable way
* To grow ourselves to better be able to fulfil the previous two objectives

Using company resources for another reason is against the spirit of this code of conduct. 

## 2 - AVOIDING CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS
Bribes, gifts, benefits in kind

Reporting conflicts of interest in ourselves
Reporting conflicts in others.

## 3 - RESPECTING OUR CUSTOMERS, PARTNERS, AND COMPETITORS
We respect our customers, partners and competitors. We do not think or speak ill of them. 

We value our competition as our greatest ally and truest friends in our quest to better our selves and contribute to this world.

We know that acting in our customer's best interest is the best choice for Sigma Forge, even if it means leading our customers away from our products to offerings better suited for their need today.

We assume good intentions unless proven otherwise. When choosing our actions during conflict or doubt, we err to the side of the customer or the most disadvantaged party. 

When dealing with our customers and partners, we commit to listening to them and to excercise our empathy and compassion. We sublime our ego when it is most difficult to do so, to remain professional and courteous in order to find positive outcomes for all.

We understand that being professional does not mean having to forego the personal. We encourage friendly informal communication.

## 4 - DISCRIMINATION AND HARRASMENT

Sigma Forge is dedicated to providing a harassment-free work environment for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of staff in any form.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members of staff. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you and are not appropriate in the workplace.

We encourage an open, friendly and postive work environment with a strong team spirit where employees feel motivated and happy.


## 5 - DUTY TO CARE
We have a duty to care about our work and its effect on the world. 

We are all personally responsible for the products that are created by Sigma Forge, and every one of us has a duty to ensure that all our products and our customers' experience are of the highest quality and that what we create has a positive impact on the world. 

Every member of Sigma Forge has the authority to stop any product from reaching the customer, or of intervening in the customer experience if either do not meet the highest standard of quality. 

We believe that the words “It’s someone else’s problem” are toxic to our organisation. **We are all personally responsible for the success of this company and for its impact on the world.**

Our duty to care extends beyond our work and to the people we interact with as part of our business and our lives. We create a welcoming and safe environment for our peers and our customers, and are compelled to act when we notice we do not meet these expectations. 

## 6 - REPRESENTING OUR PEERS
We understand that our actions represent our peers at all time, and act accordingly. When in the community, we are good citizens, and respect our surroundings and environment to create goodwill on behalf of our peers. 

We are never afraid to lend a hand, and embrace getting our hands dirty. We know that no work worth doing is demeaning, and that all work is a way of contributing to our surroundings. We know that the manner in which we act and the quality of our work is a reflection of our selves and our values.

## 7 - ACCOUNTABILITY
We nurture each other and help each other grow. We hold ourselves and each other accountable to this code of conduct, and have a duty to report any breach. Breaches can be reported directly to the director of the company at ceo@sigmaforge.com. 

We take our commitment to ethical conduct seriously, and we investigate and act upon all reported breaches of this code of conduct. 

If the director falls short of this code of conduct, breaches can be reported directly to our company ethical advisor at ethics@sigmaforge.com. 

We will not retaliate in any way against anyone who reports a breach of this code of conduct. We are thankful that they care and value the growth that their action enables.
