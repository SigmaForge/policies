Transparency
==============

As part of our commitment to radical openness and honesty, we make many of the documents that guide our actions and govern [Sigma Forge](http://sigamforge.com) publicly available. 

This repository contains all the important governance documents for Sigma Forge. We welcome suggestions for change either as a pull request or by email at transparency@sigmaforge.com.

If we fail to live up to the standards we describe, please hold us accountable by emailing the director directly at director@sigmaforge.com. If for any reason this would be innapropriate, contact our ethics advisor directly at ethics@sigmaforge.com.
